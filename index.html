            <h1>Coming Soon…</h1>

            <p>Welcome to It’sAWorkingTitleCon! Thanks to the overwhelming reception of our audience, sponsors, and volunteer group, IAWTC has become a reality!</p>

            <p>It’sAWorkingTitleCon brings the vibrant energy from the show My Little Pony, and packs the fun and joy of our community into a single weekend. We have vendors, musicians, and performers curating a once-in-a-lifetime showdown for you this weekend. And I would be remiss not to mention the events our core staff has planned, from a personalized tour of the city... to a scuba diving lesson!</p>

            <p>Join us in Equestria as we become the FIRST United States My Little Pony convention of this decade! Let’s rodeo!</p>

            <h1>Announcing our First Wave of Guests of Honor!</h1>

            <p>You asked for them, and filly, we deliver! Introducing our first wave of guests, ranging from impeccable artists to the face of Scootaloo! Check out where to find them below!</p>

            <!-- TODO Insert Images of the first three GoHs: SaxGuy, Lahtdah, and DeadParrot222. -->

            <h1>Vendors? We don’t even know her!</h1>

            <p>A genuine thank you to every artist, convention, and creative who submitted applications to fill our Year 1 Vendor Hall. We hope to grow and host even more next time, but for now, please welcome our vendors</p>

            <!-- TODO insert image of Vendor Hall, and maybe a list of names with hotlinks that lead to their “websites”? -->

            <h1>Thanks for All the Fibsh</h1>

            <p>You’ve heard the spiel once, twice, a hundred times. But you never quite realize the impact our community has until it up and smacks you in the head. Without the ingenuity, generosity, and passion of our team and our attendees, this convention would be nothing more than a dream. And yet, here we are, about to celebrate the beginning of a prosperous new decade with a brand new pony convention.</p>

            <p>Here’s to you, friends. Now let’s have a great weekend!</p>
